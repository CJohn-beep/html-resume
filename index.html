<h3>ACHIEVEMENTS/ PROJECTS</h3>
<p>Retro Music Player App<br />
  <br />
  Languages used to develop this app were Java and SQLite for the database. This was an Android application we worked on for a ﬁnal project in my Android development course. Developed the app for the purpose of music entertainment by the user. I focused mainly on the database, which was the back end while working alongside my partner Feshete Charles De-Gualle from Zimbabwe who dealt with the front end that was done in Java. 
  <br />
  <br /> Library Management System <br /><br />
  I developed the System in Python and used SQL for the database. The main purpose of this application was to simulate how a computerized system could replace the traditional way a library works. 
  <br /><br />Mobile Healthcare Android App <br /><br />
  I used Java to develop this app and SQLite for the database. This application is dedicated to delivering the best solution for the interaction between healthcare providers and those seeking medical attention. I worked on this app with the assistance of Professor Wenying Zheng who was my supervisor at the time.
